# Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
This is my first project in the Udacity Nanodegree, and the aim of this project is to use the CRISP-DM Methodology to provide answers to some business questions.

## Libraries
Libraries which necessary to run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook are as follows:

- pandas:  For creating and manipulating dataframes and using in-built functions and features for data manipulation
- numpy:   For creating and manipulating dataframes and using in-built functions and features for data manipulation
- matplotlib: For generating plots and various data visualizations
- seaborn: A wrapper for matplotlib that generates compelling visualizations
- sklearn:  To develop a linear regression machine learning model for the inflow-outflow ratio

## Project Motivation
I will be using Airbnb data for the city of Seattle with the interest of determining where to stay based on many criteria:

What are the most popular neighborhoods?

What are the most expensive neighborhoods?

How much would it cost for a couple per day to stay in Seattle Airbnb homes?

The Most Busy time in the year?

What are the most common type of Airbnb properties in Seattle?

Does the price influence the rating?

The most given "Rating" ?

What other factors affect flat prices?
