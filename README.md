# Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
This is my first project for the Udacity Nanodegree, and the goal is to use the CRISP-DM Methodology to answer some business questions.

## Libraries
The following libraries are required to run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook:

- pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes, as well as using built-in data manipulation functions and features
- numpy: For creating and manipulating dataframes, as well as using built-in data manipulation functions and features
- matplotlib: For creating plots and other types of data visualizations.
- seaborn: A matplotlib wrapper that produces eye-catching visualizations
- sklearn: Create a linear regression machine learning model for inflow data.


## Project Motivation
I intend to use Airbnb data for the city of Seattle to determine where to stay based on a variety of criteria:

-What are the most popular neighborhoods?

-What are the most expensive neighborhoods?

-How much would it cost for a couple per day to stay in Seattle Airbnb homes?

-The Busiest time of the year?

-What are the most common types of Airbnb properties in Seattle?

-Does the price influence the rating?

-The most frequent “Rating”?

-What other factors affect flat prices?

## File Descriptions

├── README.md

├── calendar.csv

├── listings.csv

├── reviews.csv

├── seattle_airbnb.ipynb

There is one notebook available for displaying work related to the questions above. Markdown cells were used to help with the thought process for individual steps.

The three csv files used in the analysis were obtained from Kaggle.

## Results

Using data from Airbnb Seattle, we attempted to understand the factors influencing booking prices in this analysis. The method described above can also be used to analyze Airbnb data for other cities.

*According to the number of listings, the top five most popular neighborhoods are Broadway, Belltown, Wallingford, Fremont, and Minor.

*The most expensive neighborhoods were Southeast Magnolia (average price of 242) and Portage Bay (average price of 227). Olympic Hills, at 73, and Rainier Beach, at 68, were the most affordable areas.

*A single night's stay in Airbnb Seattle would cost around 91 dollars and 112 dollars for a couple.

*Because summer is the busiest season, the prices are the highest.

*With 1,733 houses and 1,708 apartments, houses and apartments account for 90% of all Airbnb properties in Seattle. Nell can stay in a Yurt, Dorm, or Chalet in Seattle.

*The price has no bearing on the rating.

*People tend to give higher ratings.

*The booking price is affected by the basic configuration of the properties (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, and accommodations).
