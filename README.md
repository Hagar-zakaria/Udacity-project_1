# Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
This is my first project in the Udacity Nanodegree, and the aim of this project is to use the CRISP-DM Methodology to provide answers to some business questions.

## Libraries
Libraries which necessary to run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook are as follows:

- pandas:  For creating and manipulating dataframes and using in-built functions and features for data manipulation
- numpy:   For creating and manipulating dataframes and using in-built functions and features for data manipulation
- matplotlib: For generating plots and various data visualizations
- seaborn: A wrapper for matplotlib that generates compelling visualizations
- sklearn:  To develop a linear regression machine learning model for the inflow-outflow ratio

## Project Motivation
I will be using Airbnb data for the city of Seattle with the interest of determining where to stay based on many criteria:

-What are the most popular neighborhoods?

-What are the most expensive neighborhoods?

-How much would it cost for a couple per day to stay in Seattle Airbnb homes?

-The Most Busy time in the year?

-What are the most common type of Airbnb properties in Seattle?

-Does the price influence the rating?

-The most given "Rating" ?

-What other factors affect flat prices?

## File Descriptions
seattle_airbnb_exploratory_data_analysis/
├── README.md

├── calendar.csv

├── listings.csv

├── reviews.csv

├── seattle_airbnb.ipynb

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There 3 csv files used for the analysis are downloaded from kaggle.

## Results

In this analysis we tried to understand the factors affecting the booking prices with the help of Airbnb Seattle data. The above approach can be used to analyze Airbnb data for other cities as well.

*Based on the number of listings in a given neighborhood, the top five most popular neighborhoods are Broadway, Belltown, Wallingford, Fremont, and Minor.

*The top five most expensive neighborhoods are Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay, Westlake, West Queen Anne, and Industrial District.

*One night-stay in Airbnb Seattle would cost close to 91 dollars for a single person and 112 dollars for a couple.

*Summertime is busiest so the highest price during this season.

*Houses and apartments occupy 90% of all Airbnb properties in Seattle with 1,733 houses followed by 1,708 apartments. Yurt, Dorm, and Chalet are available for Nell in Seattle.

*The price does not affect the rating.

*People tend to give a more high rating.

*Basic configuration of the properties (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, beds and accomodates) affect the booking price.
